# Ex3

# Description
At this project we used with python 
We created classes that represent directed weighted graph and used some algorithms
In the next step we were suppose to compare our implementation performance vs NetworkX and Java implementation

## About the project:
At this project have 3 interface : GraphAlgoInterface.py ,GraphInterface.py , NodeDataInterface.py
DiGraph.py implements GraphInterface interface 
GraphAlgo.py implements GraphAlgoInterface interface
NodeData.py implements NodeDataInterface interface

we created Directed Weighted Graph but in python instead of java, and add a new method(etc strong connected components)
we added the ability to plot graph and saving the graph to a json format and loading a graph from a json format.
Comparing the graph performance vs NetworkX library and The java implementation from Ex2.


Example to a graph with random positions

Example to a graph with given positions:
A5 graph
