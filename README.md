# Ex3

# Description
At this project we used with python <br />
We created classes that represent directed weighted graph and used some algorithms <br />
In the next step we were suppose to compare our implementation performance vs NetworkX and Java implementation <br />

## About the project:
* At this project have 3 interface : GraphAlgoInterface.py ,GraphInterface.py , NodeDataInterface.py <br />
DiGraph.py implements GraphInterface interface  <br />
GraphAlgo.py implements GraphAlgoInterface interface <br />
NodeData.py implements NodeDataInterface interface <br />

* we created Directed Weighted Graph but in python instead of java, and add a new method(etc strong connected components) <br />
* we added the ability to plot graph and saving the graph to a json format and loading a graph from a json format. <br />
* Comparing the graph performance vs NetworkX library and The java implementation from Ex2. <br />
