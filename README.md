# Directed Weighted Graph In Python


# Description
At this project we used with python <br />
We created classes that represent directed weighted graph and used some algorithms <br />
we added the ability to plot graph and saving the graph to a json format and loading a graph from a json format  <br />
At the last step, we were suppose to compare our implementation performance vs NetworkX and Java implementation <br />

## Part 1:
* At this part, we create class DiGraph.py that implements GraphInterface abstract that represents an interface that represent a directed Weighted Graph  <br />
* At This section we deals with the structure of the vertices,edges,weight and neighbors of the nodes
* unit test.

## Part 2:
* At this part, we create class GraphAlgo.py that implements GraphAlgo  abstract that represents an interface that represent futnction and algorithms on the graph. example of the algorithms: shortest path, connected component and more .
* In addition, the ability to plot graph(The Visual painting of the graph) and saving the graph to a json format and loading a graph from a json format <br />
* unit test.

## Part 3:
At this project we comparing the graph performance vs NetworkX library and The java implementation from Ex2.
